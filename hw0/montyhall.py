"""
Function
--------
simulate_prizedoor

Generate a random array of 0s, 1s, and 2s, representing
hiding a prize between door 0, door 1, and door 2

Parameters
----------
nsim : int
    The number of simulations to run

Returns
-------
sims : array
    Random array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

Example
-------
>>> print simulate_prizedoor(3)
array([0, 0, 2])

"""
Function
--------
simulate_guess

Return any strategy for guessing which door a prize is behind. This
could be a random strategy, one that always guesses 2, whatever.

Parameters
----------
nsim : int
    The number of simulations to generate guesses for

Returns
-------
guesses : array
    An array of guesses. Each guess is a 0, 1, or 2

Example
-------
>>> print simulate_guess(5)
array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

Function
--------
goat_door

Simulate the opening of a "goat door" that doesn't contain the prize,
and is different from the contestants guess

Parameters
----------
prizedoors : array
    The door that the prize is behind in each simulation
guesses : array
    THe door that the contestant guessed in each simulation

Returns
-------
goats : array
    The goat door that is opened for each simulation. Each item is 0, 1, or 2, and is different
    from both prizedoors and guesses

Examples
--------

Returns
-------
